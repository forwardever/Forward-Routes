Forward::Guides::Routes::ResourceCustomization - Customizing resourceful routes

=head1 namespace

The C<-namespace> option works like the C<namespace> command. It might be
needed to determine the full controller class name ($match->class).
It also effects the names automatically generated for your routes, so make sure
to use C<app_namespace> instead of C<namespace> for your application base
namespace to keep route names as short as possible (use namespace for sub
namespaces only).

    my $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    $r->add_resources('users' => -namespace => 'Admin');

    # which is equivalent to
    my $r = Forward::Routes->new->namespace('Admin');
    $r->add_resources('users');
    

    $m = $r->match(get => 'users');
    # controller param is still 'Users'...
    # $m->[0]->params is {controller => 'Users', action => 'index'};
    # ... but:
    # $m->[0]->class is "Admin::Users"
    # $m->[0]->action is "index"
    # $m->[0]->name is "admin_users_index"

    my $path = $r->build_path('admin_users_index');
    # $path->{path} is 'users'
    # $path->{method} is 'get'

The C<-namespace> option has no effect on the URL pattern,

    # in order to match /admin/users instead of /users,
    $r->add_route('admin')->add_resources('users' => -namespace => 'Admin');

This offers a lot more flexibility:

    $r->bridge('admin')->to('Authorization#admin')
      ->add_resources('users' => -namespace => 'Admin');
    # allows to check whether the current user is really the admin (using
    # bridges) and break the dispatching cycle if authorization fails

Changes of a resources namespace also effects nested resources (inheritance)!

=head1 as

The first part of the URL pattern can be changed with the help of the C<-as>
option.

    my $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    $r->add_resources(
        'photos',
        'users' => -as => 'customers',
        'prices'
    );

    $m = $r->match(get => 'customers');
    # $m->[0]->params is {controller => 'Users', action => 'index'};

    $m = $r->match(get => 'users');
    # $m is undef

    my $path = $r->build_path('users_index');
    # $path->{path} is 'customers'
    # $path->{method} is 'get'

=head1 constraints

The resource id placeholder can be assigned a custom constraint using the
C<-constraint> option:

    my $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    $r->add_resources(
        'users',
        'photos' => -constraints => {id => qr/\d{6}/},
        'tags'
    );
    
    my $m = $r->match(get => 'photos/123456');
    # $m->[0]->params is {controller => 'Photos', action => 'show', id => 123456};
    
    $m = $r->match(get => 'photos/abc');
    # $m is undef;


=head1 format

The format constraint can be changed with the help of the C<-format> option:

    my $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    $r->add_resources(
        'users',
        'photos' => -format => 'html',
        'tags'
    );
    
    my $m = $r->match(get => 'photos/123456.html');
    # $m->[0]->params is {format => 'html', controller => 'Photos', action => 'show',
    #   id => 123456};
    
    $m = $r->match(get => 'photos/123456');
    # $m is undef;


Resources inherit the file extension of their parent. As a result, the format
constraint can also be changed through format inheritance:

    # in order to match get => /cities/paris/edit.html

    # Routes root object
    my $root = Forward::Routes->new;

    # Create a parent route with format "html"
    $route_with_html_extension = $root->add_route->format('html');

    # add a resource on top of parent
    $route_with_html_extension->add_resources('cities');
    
    $m = $root->match(get => '/cities/paris/edit.html');
    # $m->[0]->params is
    #   {controller => 'Cities', action => 'cities_update_form',
    #    format => 'html'};

The inherited format behaviour can be overwritten with the C<-format> option
for individual resources.


=head1 only

Instead of creating all default resourceful routes for a resource (i.e. index,
create, show, update, delete, create_form, update_form, delete_form), only
selected routes can be generated using the C<-only> option.

    # only generate the "create" and "show" routes for the "users" resource
    my $root = Forward::Routes->new;
    $root->add_resources(
        'photos',
        'users' => -only => ['create', 'show'],
        'prices'
    );
    
    my $m = $root->match(get => 'users');
    # $m is undef, as "index" not included via "only"
    
    $m = $root->match(post => 'users');
    # create:
    # $m->[0]->params is {controller => 'Users', action => 'create'};
    
    $m = $root->match(get => 'users/1');
    # show
    # $m->[0]->params is {controller => 'Users', action => 'show', id => 1};
