Changes for Forward::Routes

0.56    2013-07-12 00:00:00
        - custom id names for resources (e.g. my_id instead of id)
        - API change: resource names such as 'new' and 'edit' can become
          id placeholder values if request method does not match or if
          there is no match because of 'only' option
        - API Change: the "as" option for resources now changes the
          automatic naming of routes and controllers, it no longer
          changes the path pattern of the URL (inverse behaviour, rails like)
        - API Change: use shorter names for frequent use cases and longer
          names for edge cases for nested resources (rails like)
        - API Change: nested resources: do not include namespace in
          capture names (untested/not specified behaviour in the past)

0.55    2013-07-12 00:00:00
        - cleanup and refactoring
        - fixed automatic route name generation for adding collection and member routes
          on nested resources
        - make sure that inheritance works if options are passed within add_route
          command (embedded option, no chaining)

0.54    2013-07-08 00:00:00
        - removed method 'method', not documented, use 'via' instead

0.53    2013-02-22 00:00:00
        - performance improvements for building paths
        - make sure that multiple calls to constraints methods does not result in reset of previous constraints

0.52    2012-11-07 00:00:00
        - sort methods in Forward::Routes by category and name
        - bug fix for path building: make sure that params with empty values
          behave like undef params

0.51    2012-02-16 00:00:00
        - added block syntax (api alternativ)
        - added tests for empty routes and home paths
        - allow more flexible path building in case of multiple format
          contraints for a route

        - fixed bridges and added tests
        - fixed format inheritance and added tests

        - fixed README

0.48    2011-08-26 00:00:00
        - added "app_namespace" method which should be used to define the apps
          base namespace (as it has no effect on autogenerated resource names
          in contrast to method "namespace")
        - added docs and tests for namespace methods
        - renamed method "controller_class" to "class" (in Match class)
        - added method "controller" to Match class (provides the last part of
          the full class namespace)

0.47    2011-08-24 00:00:00
        - Made namespace customization for resourceful routes more consistent
          (works more like default namespace option for standard routes, e.g.
           nested resources and routes inherit namespace from parent resource)
        - Full controller class name for resources is only provided by
          $match->controller_class accessor (no longer by controller param)

0.46    2011-08-24 00:00:00
        - Added namespace method and namespace inheritance to Routes, added
          controller_class and action accessors to Routes::Match
